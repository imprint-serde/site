Merging two Imprint rows with compatible schemas (there are no fields with the
same name and different types) can be done by sort-merging the field directories
and conatenating the payloads, modifying the directory for trailing messages by
incrementing the offset by the length of the payload of A:

```
new_payload = A.payload || B.payload
new_directory = A.dir âˆª (B.dir offset+|A|)
new_fieldcount = A.N + B.N
```

If the field directories are not disjoint, the directory will only include
the directory entry for the first field. This means the order of composition 
matters as the payload in the second record will be ignored (or, optionally,
the second payload can be modified to remove the discarded value to save 
space).

The results of benchmarking a basic merge use case when compared to protobuf
show that Imprint is able to merge records of increasingly large size in constant
time while Protobuf degrades linearly with the size of the input records. In a
simple benchmark, Imprint performs up to 76% better than protobuf at merging two
records.
