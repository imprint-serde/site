Projection can be done without deserializing any of the payload. After
parsing the header and the field directory, the byte slices within the
payload can be directly referenced and appended to a new buffer.

```
header = parse header
fields = parse field directory

new_schema = []
new_payload = []
for field in fields:
  if field is in projection:
    new_schema.append(field)
    new_payload.append(payload.bytes[field.offset:field.offset + field.length])
```

Similarly to merging records, Imprint projection is constant to the data being
projected as opposed to the size of the input record while protobuf projection
performance degrades linearly as the size of the input record increases.
